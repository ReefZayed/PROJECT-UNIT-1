## My Project Is A "Coffee Machine":
 that sells coffee. The machine contains four types of coffee: "latte"," black coffee", "cappuccino", and "tea". 
 We have a coffee distributor and the user:
 As a coffee distributor, I display the menu to the user 
 As a user, I must be able to choose the type of coffee and pay.
 
 ## Project includes:
 ** one class "DispenserCoffe" -> represents a product dispenser. It has the following methods:
   -  get_no_of_items  -> This method returns the current number of items left in the dispenser>
   -  get_cost         -> This method returns the cost of the products 
   -  make_sale        -> This method is called when a sale is made, reducing the number of items in the dispenser by 1.
   -  sell_produc      -> This function handles the process of selling a product. 

#### Usage :
 Explain to the user how to use your project:

 - Choose the type of coffee you want:  
     - A message will appear with the cost of the coffee. 
     - You are asked to  enter the cost for product.
     - If it is less, you will be asked to complete the amount. 
     - If it is higher than the cost of the product, a message will appear to you that includes the rest
        for you and do you want to complete and take your drink or recover the full amount and try again 
     - if the amount is equal For the cost of the product it will show you your drink .
